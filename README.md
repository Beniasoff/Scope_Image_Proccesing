### Steps

1. **Convert to Grayscale**: The input image is converted to a grayscale image.
2. **Apply Gaussian Filter**: A Gaussian filter is applied to the grayscale image to smooth it.
3. **Initialize Graph**: A graph is initialized with nodes representing each pixel in the image.
4. **Define Neighbor Offsets**: Neighbor offsets for 8-connectivity are defined.
5. **Add Edges**: Edges are added between nodes based on the 10 percent rule and the epsilon value.

### Example Usage

```julia
using Images, Plots, Graphs, Colors, ImageFiltering, LinearAlgebra, ImageProjectiveGeometry

# Load an example image
img = load("path_to_image.jpg")

# Process the image
retain = 0.1
segments = 5
sigma = 1.0
epsilon = 0.1
processed_graph = processImage(img, retain, segments, sigma, epsilon)

# Visualize the processed image (example visualization)
gray_img = Gray.(img)
filtered_img = imfilter(gray_img, Kernel.gaussian(sigma))
imshow(filtered_img)
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the input image is loaded correctly and is in a format supported by the [`Images`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Images%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenniasoff%2FVscode%2Fchemlab%2Fsound%2FFucntions.jl%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenniasoff%2FVscode%2Fchemlab%2Fsound%2FFucntions.jl%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenniasoff%2FVscode%2Fchemlab%2Fsound%2FFucntions.jl%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") package.
